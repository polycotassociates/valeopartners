This module is intended to make drupal work correctly with local timezones instead of standart drupal time offsets.
To use them just apply patch common.inc.diff to includes/common.inc.
After that turn in DST in /admin/settings/dst and that's all.

Instructions on how to patch drupal core for correct work:
 1. Open a shell 
 2. cd /includes
 3. patch < ../sites/all/modules/dst/common.inc.diff (path to module may differ)
